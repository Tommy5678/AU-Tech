    <pre class="a-text"> 
        Ever since Facebook decided to chart a new future toward the metaverse, even changing its name to mark the 
        shift, the term has become ubiquitous. Myriad startups and public companies are slathering themselves with the 
        term in hopes of catching the wave.

        Is the metaverse a social-crypto environment, bringing together human interaction and decentralized ledgers? 
        Perhaps that’s part of it, but it doesn’t feel sufficiently complete a definition.

        The Meta approach appears to start from the perspective of personal representation inside a persistent, video-
        game like environment. This means that the ‘metaverse’ is akin to an MMORPG, but without a genre-specific quest 
        focus; it’s more open-ended, and thus more open to continued thematic expansion. The more crypto, or web3, 
        approach is to consider digital assets that can be viewed as an extension of one’s self as the metaverse, or at 
        least part of it. 
        A “PFP NFT” being, for example, how you want to display yourself in a digital environment. That sort of thing.

        It’s possible to imagine a hybridization of the two definitions. A place where you and I might have a persistent 
        avatar of sorts and digital goods are recorded on some sort of decentralized ledger.

        The issue with that vision is that it’s not super possible to build at the moment. Why? Because there isn’t a way 
        to build an MMORPG atop the blockchain, and companies able to build such a platform don’t want to allow for 
        decentralized asset creation and management, as it would limit their ability to rip value out of their game or 
        digital living environment.

        Yes, this is tension between decentralized and centralized systems, but in this case it’s a useful divide to note as it 
        appears to be keeping what could be the metaverse from reach. It is not too hard to come up with a way forward. 
        For example:

        • A DAO is created to collect several billion dollars.
        • The DAO funds the creation and maintenance of a persistent digital environment, perhaps with its own token.
        • The software — a fusion of Minecraft, Slack, the Unreal engine, and not Elden Ring — is open for folks to mod, make 
          worlds, and so forth, perhaps even allowing companies to build more virtual offices.
        • From there, everyone can participate and do their thing as they will.

        Is that a compelling metaverse? I guess at this juncture if that isn’t then we need to entirely rewrite what we 
        mean when we say the word. Because that’s as close as I can smush things together without literally dropping all 
        current definitions and starting over from scratch.
