        <h2 class="heading-2">TWITTER ROLLS OUT ITS CLOSED CAPTION TOGGLE ON iOS AND ANDROID</h2>
        <br><br>
        <img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-2021-10-d.jpg?w=1390&crop=1" width="30%" height="20%" class="centre"><br><br>
        <pre class="a-text">
            Twitter announced this week that it’s introducing a few new features for users. Most notably,
            the social media giant is rolling out its closed caption toggle to all users on iOS and 
            Android. Twitter began testing the toggle in April and is now bringing it to all users on 
            mobile. The CC button will appear in the top-right corner of a video that has captions 
            available. You can then tap the button to turn captions on or off.

            The official launch comes as the company rolled out auto-generated captions on videos last 
            December to make videos more accessible for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. Auto captions 
            are available on web, iOS and Android in more than 30 languages, including English, Spanish, 
            Japanese, Arabic, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and more.

            Twitter has also announced that it wants to make it easier for users to start a Space and is 
            launching two experiments on iOS. The first experiment will allow iOS users to start a Space 
            from the tweet composer. To do so, you can tap on the Spaces icon in the tweet composer to 
            start a new space. The second experiment will let iOS users start a space from the retweet 
            menu. When you start a Space from the retweet menu, it will skip the usual set up and 
            immediately go live. The tweet will then automatically be pinned at the top of the Space.

            In addition, Twitter also announced that it’s testing a new way for hosts and speakers to share 
            tweets in a Space via the retweet menu.

            These new features aren’t the only ones that Twitter announced this week, as Twitter has 
            started testing “Notes,” a way to write and publish long-form content on the social media 
            platform. A small group of writers in the United States, Canada, Ghana and the United Kingdom 
            now have access to Notes as part of the initial testing phase.

            Twitter says Notes can be read on and off Twitter by people in most countries. Users who are 
            part of the testing phase will get access to a new “Write” tab, which is where they can write 
            and access all of their Notes. These users will also have a new “Notes” tab in their profile 
            that holds their published work to make it easy for their followers to find their long-form content.
