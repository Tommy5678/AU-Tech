        <br><br>

            Soon after Google revealed that it was banning call recording apps, Truecaller announced to remove the 
            call recording feature from its platform. Google on Thursday announced the removal of all apps with 
            the call recording feature starting May 11.

            Commenting on the matter, a Truecaller spokesperson said, “as per the updated Google Developer Program
            policies, we are unable to offer call recordings any longer. This will not affect devices that have call 
            recording built into the device natively."
                                                                                    
            "We had introduced call recording for all Android smartphones based on overwhelming consumer demand.
            Call Recording on Truecaller was free for everyone, permission-based and required users to enable 
            the feature using the Google Accessibility API,” the spokesperson further detailed.
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
            Google has been against call recording apps and services for many years now, as the company believes it 
            to be an invasion of user’s privacy. For the same reason, the call recording feature on Google’s own
            Dialer app comes with a loud “this call is now being recorded” alert, which is heard on both 
            sides before recording begins.

            To recall, Google blocked real-time call recording on Android 6, then, with Android 10, it removed in-call 
            audio recording over the microphone. Some apps, though, found a loophole in Android to access the 
            Accessibility Service to offer the call recording functionality on devices running on Android 10 and 
            above. “The Accessibility API is not designed and cannot be requested for remote call audio recording,”
            one of the clauses from the updated Play Store policies reads.

            Google also clarified that the change will affect only third-party apps. This clearly means that call recording  
            on the Google Dialer will still function if it is available on your device or region. This also suggests 
            that any preloaded Dialer apps with a call recording feature will also function. Only the apps downloaded 
            from the Google Play store will be removed. So, any app that allows users to record calls 
            will be blocked on the Play store on May 11.
